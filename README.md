This is a bot template to get you started with using Mix. It is automatically cloned using [Mix CLI](https://github.com/discord-mix/mix-cli).

If you have any questions, refer to [my Discord support server](https://discord.gg/kmFDMwT) to contact me.

#### Getting Started Using the CLI Utility

*Please refer to [the official Mix repository](https://github.com/discord-mix/mix) for installation instructions.*

#### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. A configuration utility will appear (use `npm run config` if it doesn't)
    * If you would like to configure your bot manually (*maybe the config. utility is failing*), follow these steps:
        1. Copy `.env.example` into `.env`
        2. Configure `.env`
        3. You're done! Run the bot.
4. Start the bot using `npm start`
